# Neural Style Transfer

This repository contains the implementation  of the Neural Style Transfer method, a technque described in the paper, [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by Leon A. Gaty.

I have used Tensorflow and Keras to perform neural style transfer. 

Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take three images, a content image, a style reference image, and the input image you want to style and blend them together such that the input image is transformed to look like the content image. The output image looks “painted” in the style of the style image.
